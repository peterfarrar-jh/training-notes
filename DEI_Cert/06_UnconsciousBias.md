# Unconscious Bias

- Stacey Gordon

## Introduction

### Why identify your bias?

Action without awareness leads to performative, ineffective action.  

**Affinity Bias:** Favoring people who are similar to us.  

**Perception Bias:** Tendency to form stereotypes and assumptions about a group of people.  

## 1. The Basics of Unconscious Bias

### What is unconscious bias?

"Only 6% of S&P 500 companies are run by women." \- Catalyst research  

"Fewer than 3% of Fourtune 500 board directors are openly LGBTQ+." \- Catalyst research  

**Unconscious Bias:** "Attitudes or stereotypes that affect our views, actions, and decision-making ability".  
\- American Occupational Therapy Association. 

* We all have biases.

### The impact of a 1% bias

Applying a 1% bias towards promoting men at every six month review for 10 years resulted in 65% of senior positions being held by men.  

Failure to attend to unconscious bias can impede positive organizational change and resilience.  

What aspect of the promotion and development process would you like to see modified?  

How are you going to distinguish your company as an employer of choice?  

### The basis of unconscious bias

About 99% of our thoughts are unconscious.  
\- Timothy D. Wilson, Strangers to Ourselves  

Lack of awareness or attention to our perspectives means we don't realize how bias we are.  

It is estimated that there are 180+ cognitive biases.  

Heuristics are the **shortcuts** that humans use to reduce task complexity in judgement and choice, and biases are the **assumptions** we make based on those shortcuts.  

What made us act that way towards that person or group?  

We **can** interrupt our biases.  

### Unconscious bias at work

Turnover costs roughly six to nine months of an employee's salary.  
\- Lynchburg Regional SHRM

Making employees aware of that costs about $1300 per employee.  

* Have you encountered unconscious bias, lack of diversity, and inequality in the workplace?
* How was it handled?
* Are you fully engaged at your workplace?
* Have you talked to a manager or HR about it?
* What suggestions would you make to improve the place where you work?

## 2. Common Forms of Unconscious Bias

### Affinity bias

**Affinity Bias:** Favoring people who are similar to us.  

Create standard processes to help reduce unconscious bias.  

### Halo bias

**Halo Effect:** Tendency to think a person is good because of a good first impression.  

* Who wears the halo in your life and is there anything you can do about it?
* Are you in an environment where grievances are taken seriously?
* Did the person to whom you assigned the work actually do the work?

### Perception bais

**Perception Bais:** Tendency to form stereotypes and assumptions about a group of people.  

#### Overcoming Unconscious Bias

* Acknowledge problem exists
* Spread awareness
* Resolve to do something about it
* Hold yourself accountable

What steps can you take today to change your perceptions?  

Reamin curious and question assumptions.  

### Confirmation bias

**Confirmation Bias:** "Seeking out evidence that confirms our initial perceptions, ignoring contrary information".  
\- Swedish Organization for Global Health.  

* Review all available data
* Ask others to review your conclusions
* Use standard evaluation system

Are there systems in place for employee evaluations?  
Is your work regularly reviewed?  
Is there consistent data that can be used to reward positive behavior?  
Is there a process in place for spending?  
How are funds allocated to different departments?  
Are requests evaluated objectively?  

### Groupthink

**Groupthink:** When individuals try to fit into a group by agreeing with the majority, or stifling opinions that may differ from the group.  

1. Take on the role of dissenter.
2. If you have authority, avoid stating your preferences first.
3. Reserve time to critically evaluate options.
4. Invite an impartial third party to challenge opinions.
