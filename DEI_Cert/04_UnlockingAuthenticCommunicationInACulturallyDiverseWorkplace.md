## 1. Principles of Authentic Communications

### What does it mean to be authentic?

**Authenticity** means being yourself and being able to receive recognition and acceptance from peers.  

#### Human Transactional Equation

* How do you see yourself, and how do people see you?
* How do you see others, and how do they see themselves?

Build your knowledge base and emotional intelligence.  

### Understand cultural diversity in the workplace

**Cultural diversity** preserves and celebrates differences and protects those who may be at risk from discrimination.  

Look at the intersection between these three factors:  

* Organizational culture
* Individuals
* Accessibility and inclusion

Is cultural diversity talked about and understood at the same level?  
Can everyone participate freely?  

Examples of signs that cultural diversity is not being celebrated:  

* No black people in the company
* No women in senior management
* They wish you "Happy Easter", but they don't do it for Muslim and Jewish festivals

Tackle the big issues of representation first.  

### Undoing the damage created by poor communication

"Surround yourself with radiators, not drains."  

Acknowledge people's pain and lived experiences.  

Accept that you're not here to judge others.  

Invite people to share their experiences.  

### Tips for productive communication
