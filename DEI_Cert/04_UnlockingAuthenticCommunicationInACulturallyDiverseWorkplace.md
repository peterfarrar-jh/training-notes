# Unlocking Authentic Communication in a Culturally-Diverse Workplace

- Jonathan Wilson

## Introduction

### Why authentic communication matters

Understand cultural and contextural nuances.  

**Authenticity** means being yourself and being able to receive recognition and acceptance from peers.  

Build social currancy.  

### Adopt an allyship mindset

Think of an **ally** as someone who's curious about deeper and meaningful differences.  

Think of **privilege** as an advantage.  

#### Stages of Adopting an Allyship Mindset

* Greater awareness
* Connection
* Action

Anyone can be an ally.  

## 1. Principles of Authentic Communications

### What does it mean to be authentic?

**Authenticity** means being yourself and being able to receive recognition and acceptance from peers.  

#### Human Transactional Equation

* How do you see yourself, and how do people see you?
* How do you see others, and how do they see themselves?

Build your knowledge base and emotional intelligence.  

### Understand cultural diversity in the workplace

**Cultural diversity** preserves and celebrates differences and protects those who may be at risk from discrimination.  

Look at the intersection between these three factors:  

* Organizational culture
* Individuals
* Accessibility and inclusion

Is cultural diversity talked about and understood at the same level?  
Can everyone participate freely?  

Examples of signs that cultural diversity is not being celebrated:  

* No black people in the company
* No women in senior management
* They wish you "Happy Easter", but they don't do it for Muslim and Jewish festivals

Tackle the big issues of representation first.  

### Undoing the damage created by poor communication

"Surround yourself with radiators, not drains."  

Acknowledge people's pain and lived experiences.  

Accept that you're not here to judge others.  

Invite people to share their experiences.  

### Tips for productive communication

1. Teach, don't preach.  
2. Nurture fruitful curiosity.  
3. Accept collective individualism.  
4. Resist shutting down uncomfortable conversations.  

## 2. Tips for Communication in a Culturally Diverse Workplace

### Make first impressions count

_Greetings in the workplace._  

Give people space. Be mindful of cultural norms.  

_Names and titles._  

**Microinvalidations** undermine someone's status.  
Forgetting someone's title.  

**Implicit discrimination** implies someone is not important or valuable.  
Like accidentally mispronouncing someones name and never learning to pronounce it correctly.  

**Microassults** are intentional actions to discriminate someone.  
Like, intentionally mispronouncing their name.  

People may use **code switching** to change or adapt aspects of themselves to fit in.  

Encourage people to be honest about how they want their name pronounced.  

### Mirroring and shared truths

Mirroring.  
Unconcious imitation of a gesture.  

Rapport.  
Considering the feelings of others and communicating freely.  

Finding common ground.  
Find pieces of information or stories that we think will match the interest of the people we're talking to.  

Build social currency.  
Acknowledge differences without dwelling on them.  
Find a way to make differences respected shared truths.  

Create safe spaces for others, listen, and signal reassurance.  

### Am I one of the gang?

**S**etting  
How does the setting influence the way your communication is received?  
**P**ermission  
Do you know the person well enough, and do they think so too?  
**E**levate  
Does what your saying help others to hold them in higher esteem, or is this just about making yourself look good?  
**C**ontext  
Does what's going on at work or in the world make your comments seem out of place?  

_Understand cultural and contextural nuances._  
Recognize and appreciate the differences in people.  

Consider the impact of your power or privilages.  

### Support safe spaces for sharing personal experiences

**Safe spaces** do not tolerate discrimination, criticism, harassment, or other harm.  

Organize meetings or social activities.  

Listen and allow people to share their experiences.  

### What to do when you get it wrong

#### Four people types not to be

**The Hippo:**  
The Highest Paid Persons Opinion.  

**The Wolf:**  
WOrking on the Latest Fire.  

**The Rino:**  
Really Here In Name Only.  

**The Zebra:**  
Zero Evidence But Really Arrogant.  

_Extra bonus animal (to be):_  
**The Lion:**  
Leans In, Obviates No One.  

Lean into conversations:  
Encourage people to be specific and explicit about their needs.  

Obviate no one:  
Everyone has to feel a sense of empowerment and legitimacy.  

Checklist:  

* So what?
* What now?
* What are we going to do about it?

### Learn through questioning

AIDA framework:  

* **A**ttention
* **I**nterest
* **D**esire
* **A**ction

Learn to question implicit factors.  

* Who never seems to get a change to express themselves?
* What's blocking participation?
* Why is no one speaking up about this?
* Where are conversations happening?
* Are those places potentially excluding anybody?
* When is a good time to raise these issues?

Know when not to ask questions.  

When asking questions, ask in a supportive mannor.  

Be careful about putting people on the spot.  

Be mindful of how underrepresented groups may feel.  

## 3. Developing Cultural Awareness

### The CULTURE framework

**C**elebrate (customs)  
**U**nderstand (where someone is coming from)  
**L**isten (to what the room has to say)  
**T**rust (show that cultural difference is a value)  
**U**nlock (the unstated needs and desires of the people you're talking to)  
**R**esist (tempation to judge too quickly)  
**E**nergize and empathize  

### Tone and authentic communication

#### Communication Styles

* Critical parent
* Nurturing parent
* Adult
* Free child
* Adapted child
