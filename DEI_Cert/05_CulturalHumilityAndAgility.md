We each see the world through our own unique lense.  

### What's in this course?

Cultural humility helps us in working effectively with others.  

Concept of cultural agility.  

A guide to the qualities you need:  

* Self-awareness

## 1. Why Do Cultural Humility and Agility Matter?

### Navigating in-group and out-group dynamics

Intersect with different cultures every day.  

Home, workplace, groups with common interests.  

Each groups identify different social networks.  

**In-Groups:**  
Groups with members who identify closely with one another.  

Examples: Groups based on family, work, gender, common religion or ethnicity.  

**Out-Groups:**  
Groups composed of members who do not have a tight connection to other members.  

When we bring new members into our groups, we need to be aware of the tendency to lean on group identity. Ignoring this could discourage or prevent people from joining our work or social circles.  

Essencial to creating harmonious, well-functioning grouops that welcome newcomers:  

* Check biases
* Be open and flexable
* Be curious
* Assume positive intent
* Have and show trust

### What is cultural humility?

#### Cultural Humility

Learning about others and being sensitive to what might influence our interactions.  

Assumes continuous learning as we engage with others.  

This is an ongoing process.  

* Power differencials 
* Historical awareness

Ask yourself questions like:  
"What are my initial reactions to people who are culturally different than me?"  
"What assumptions might I be making without clarifying them?"  
"What can I do to be sure they feel welcomed?"  

Cultural historical awareness.  

Cultural humility involves a lifelong process of learning, self-reflection, and environmental awareness.  

### What is cultural agility?

The skill of navigating work in different cultures in a respectful, knowledge-seeking and effective way.  

Cultural agility is a mega-competency.  

_Book:_ "Cultural Agility: Building a Pipeline of Successful Global Professionals"  

Cultural agility is often what someone from outside a group must demonstrate to work their way inside.  

* Know who you are and what you believe in.
* Seek harmony.
* Learn and absorb.
* Give yourself some slack.

## 2. Your Internal Processing Behaviors

### Building self- and emotional awareness

Self-awareness requires reflection. Who we are and how _others_ see us.  

95% of people think they are self-aware.  
10-15% actually are.  

"Why" and "what" questions in the context of self-reflection.  

"Why is the culture of my teammate so pessimistic about their future compared to mine?"  
"Why was her perception of the US so misinterpreted?"  
"Why did he ask so many personal questions about me?"  

"Why" questions micro-analyze before we have the information we need.  

"What can I do to better understand where my teammate's perspective is coming from?"  
"What can I find out about her past experience with US culture?"  
"What is most important to me in building a good working relationship?"  

#### 02.01. Self-Awareness  

Think of a time when you welcomed someone to a new environment in your workplace or a social setting. Here are some questions for you to ponder:
1. How can you show interest and warmth without being overbearing?
2. After you learn a bit more about the person, frame a question that allows you
to learn more about them by using a “What question” structure.
3. If you are at a higher position of authority/power or a longer tenure, think of
what you can say or do to level the playing field

### Developing empathy

Empathy helps build community and guides the cutlure of an organization.  

When a new employee enters a conversation with vetran employees that use a lot of insider jargon, it would be empathetic of someone (mgr?) to share a list of inside jargon and their meanings.  

In-group bias.  
In-group members tend to reserve their empathy for fellow in-group members.  

* Imagine seeing yourself in others' shoes.
* Connect and help.
* Strategize with the team.

#### 02.02. Empathy

Here are three scenarios where you need to flex your empathy muscle:
1. Someone cuts you off in traffic. Come up with three reasons why they might have done this that do not involve ill will.
2. Someone is late to a meeting. Before you assume that they are trying to annoy you, think of another reason that might fit their personal situation.
3. Your colleague is not responding to your messages. List three important projects that she is involved in that might be consuming her energy.

### Listening for impact

#### Mindfulness

The skill of processing information and determining what is pertinent and useful to your task at hand.  
Being in the presesnt moment without judging.  

Selective attention  

* Silence doesn't have to be passive.
* Biases need to be checked constantly.

"Tell me more about this..."  
"Help me understand..."  

Being in the moment is an active practice.  

* Information gathering
* Picture assessing
* Evaluative listening
* **Empathetic listening**

#### 02.03. Listening

Discipline yourself to listen attentively in the following three scenarios:
1. A colleague is presenting at a meeting and his pants zipper is down. He is unaware and it would be too embarrassing to tell him in front of the group. How do you stay focused on the topic?
2. You are attending a busy networking event and talking to someone who is excited about sharing their vacation plans. The conversation next to you is about a movie you just watched and loved. How do you stay with the vacation plans conversation?
3. 4. What is your most creative mode as a team? Do you use meetings? Brainstorm in Google files? Do you create documents/decks/ together?

## 3. Your External Processing Behaviors

### Being curious and inquisitive

"Curiosity can becom an intellectual virtue, helping us grow and more deeply experience the world."  

Curiosity must involve action and intention.  

Be inquisitive.  

* Use disclaimers to soften your intros.
* Use questions which show interesnt.
* Tap into your audience knowledge.

Pose questions that start with "**How**" and "**What**."  

#### 03.01. Curiosity

As you enter the new team setting ask these questions to help you better understand the team’s culture:
1. Can you tell me about the most exciting project you all worked on?
2. What is your favorite and most effective mode of communication? Do you adapt based on each person? (email, Slack, text)

### Being attuned

Different cultures may use the same queues differently.  

#### Being Attuned

* Aware of cultural differences
* Key attribute to emotional intelligence
* Increases cultural humility

Skills for attuned training program:

* Observe how other people behave in a meeting.
  * Do I konw how everyone at the meeting felt about a particular agenda item?
* "Read" TV shows and movies.
  * Watch an episode of a sitcome in a native language and see if you can figure out the plot.
* Play Barnga.
  * Situation simulation game
* Observe people in a new place.
  * Observe their stance, gestures, eye contact...
* Take a quiz

#### 03.02. Attuned

Think if these following debrief questions:
1. Does a smile trick you?
2. How much attention do you pay to a person’s eyes?
3. A slight head tilt can change the trajectory of a facial expression. Record virtual meetings to confirm that you do not do it unintentionally. The Yoodli.ai platform allows for Zoom meeting recordings and will provide you with listening and speaking feedback.
4. To come across as being welcoming, experts say you should smile with your eyes. Where can you practice this in your daily life? (hint: photos, virtual meeting introductions)

### Being open and flexible

#### Flexible Judgement

The ability to not react emotionally to new environments and to not judge based on negative past experiences or our own cultural norms.  

Different is not dificient.  

#### Increase Flexible Judgement

* Build sensitivity to differences
* Have many varied experiences

Ideas to ponder:  

* Observe differences.
* Check your biases.
* Suspend judgement.

#### 03.03. Flexible Judgment

Here are three scenarios where you can imagine yourself in where you would need to practice
your flexible judgment:
1. You are visiting a country where smoking is part of the social culture. After a big dinner the guest next to you pulls out a pack of cigarettes and offers you one. You live a healthy
lifestyle and you have never smoked. You kindly decline but think of your internal dialogue. What are the guests’ intentions? Try to stir away from being judgmental and think of the guest’s intentions.
2. You are driving a rental car in another country. The driver behind you gets uncomfortably close, flashes her lights and honks gently. This is not common practice in your country, so
it startles you. Why might the driver be doing this? Are there commonly accepted driving rules that might be different here?
3. You haven’t seen a close friend in a while. You meet for coffee, and she comments on your looking heavier. Weight comments or asking someone how much they weigh are taboo topics in your current culture. How do you process her comment without becoming upset?

## 4. Humility and Agility in New Culture COntexts

### Cracking the in-group code

What advice would you give Varun?  

* Being attuned
* Curiousity and inquisitiveness
* Self-awareness

### Welcoming outsiders

What advice would you give the intern onboarding team?  

* Empathy
* Being attuned

Creating a culture is the responsibility of the entire team.  

### Being attuned as a leader

What advice would you give Akua as she takes over the team at a difficult time?

Managers that demonstrate downward deference are more effective leaders.  

Managers who increased power distance are less effective in a new environment were less effective leaders.  

New policies need to be fair and aligned with company values.
