# Inclusive Mindset

- Dereca Blackmon

## Introduction

### Brave, humble, and dedicated: Building an inclusive mindset

Inclusion is a mindset.  

### My personal journey to an inclusive mindset

Iceberg theory of culture:  
What we see is only the surface, and most of what exists is under the surface.  

## 1. Brave Principles

### Constructive discomfort

#### Constructive Discomfort

Leaning into discomfort as a learning experience.  

Safe and Brave Space  

Center is comfort zone, outside that is the learning edge. Constructive discomfort is the travel through the learning edge up to, but not into, the danger zone.  

Unsafe vs. uncomfortable.  

Understand that everyone makes mistakes.  

### Acknowledging that everyone has privilege

#### Social Identity Groups

Age, ability, education, gender identity, body size, religious beliefs, nationality, ethnicity, class, parental status, citizenship, marital status, sexual orientation.  

Which aspects of your identity do you think about the most?  
Which ones do you think about the least?  

Notice your identities you don't often consider.  
These are likely your privilages.  

The word "Privilege" is typically associated with wealth.  

### How power impacts your DEI lens

**Agree? Disagree?**  
_"We're all a little bit racist."_  

Scale of power and consciousness.  

**How do you define each of these five words?**  

* Prejudice
* Discrimination
* Bias
* Systemic inequity
* Oppression

How are they the same or different?  

## 2. Brave Practices

### Deciding when and where to challenge bias

* Timing
  * Is this the right time to make a comment?
  * Can you address what's happening without derailing themeeting?
  * Is it important to speak up right now?
* Place
  * Will this feedback create a positive change?
  * Should you discuss the impact oft he words or actions privately with the person?
* Relationship
  * How much do you know about the impacted person?
  * Are you sure they would like for you to speak up?

### Calling in vs. calling out

* Ask for more information
* Seperate intent from impact
* Challenge stereotypes

### How to take care of yourself while practicing DEI

Not taking care of yourself can lead to burn-out.  

#### Taking care of yourself

* Set boundaries
* Build a network of allies
* Focus on the small wins

## 3. Huble Principles

### Cultural humility

* **Brave** enough to announce my pronouns
* **Humble** enough to be accountable if I offend anyone
* **Dedicated** enough to keep learning and keep being brave

#### Cultural Humility Principles

* Recognize and challenge power imbalances
* Pursue lifelong learning
* Advocate for institutional accountability

### Microaggressions and personal responsibility

#### Microaggressions

Subtle verbal and nonverbal slights, insults, indignities, and denigration messages directed towards an individual due to their group identity, often automatically, unconsciously, and unintentionally.  

These are often automatic, unconscious, and unintentional.  

* Focus on the impacted person.
* Check in with the impacted person.
  * If they want to continue the conversation, that's great.
  * Not everyone will want to, and that's okay too.

If they don't want to talk about it:  

* Apologize
* Focus on your education and growth

### Separating intention from impact

Seperate intent from impact.  
Resist the temptation to defend ourselves.  

Guilt is not a helpful emotion.  
It keeps us focused on our own feelings instead of leaning into the learning opportunity in the moment.  

An apology should be an expression of care, not a confession of your shame.  

Focus the apology on the individual and impact.  
Offer to follow up.  

## 4. Humble Practice

### Pursue your education

#### Pursuing Your Education

* Online resources
* Thought leaders and organizations
* New experiences
* Employee resource groups (ERGs)

### LEARN what to do whenyou make a mistake

* **L**ean into discomfort
* **E**ngage in deep listening
* **A**ppreciate feedback
* **R**ecognize responsibility
* **N**ext steps

#### Lean into the discomfort

* Check in with yourself

#### Engage in deep listening

* Allow the impacted person space
* Be mindful of defensiveness or dismissal

#### Appreciate Feedback

* You can say, "Thank you - I really appreciate you bringing this to my attention!"

#### Recognize Responsibiility

* An apology or acknowledgment is an expression of care

"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I am deeply committed to making sure our company is a place where everyone feels that they belong."  

#### Next Steps

* Inquire if the impacted person is willing and open to help you think about how to move forward

## 5. Dedicated Principles

### The dance of DIBE

"**Diversity** is being invited to the party. **Inclusion** is being asked to dance." - Verna Myers, inclusion strategist  

Inclusion is the set of actions people take to ensure everyone gets the same opportunities for success.  

**Belonging** is being able to dance how you want.  
**Equity** is having a turn picking the DJ.  

**Equity** is about the power of decisions that are usually made behind the scenes.  

### The allyship continuum

Allyship is a lifelong journey.  

* Self-appointed allyship
* Interrupting prejudice and discrimination
* Active commitment and accountability for our actions

## 6. Dedicated Practices

### Advocate for systemic change

Dedicated resources include:  

* DEI councils
* ERGs
* Dedicated roles

Check in with yourself. Do you have the capacity to take this on?  

Tie inclusion goals to:  

* Advancement
* Compensation

Valuable information can be gathered through:  

* Employee surveys
* Exit interviews

_Stay interviews_ are interviews for people in positions prone to turnover, or who hold identities that are marginalilzed or under represented within the organization.  

### Evaluate systems for equity

* Pay transparency
* Equity audits
* Supplier diversity
* Values

#### Business Case

Inclusion is essential to the organization's bottom line: economic and market share performance.  

#### Ethical Case

Inclusion is the right thing to do to address the impacts of historical discrimination.  

#### Personal Case

Every person can speak to why DEI matters personally to them.  

## Conclusion

**You** are a catalyst for change.
