## 1. Foundations: Equity vs. Equality

### What is equality?

"All Men are created equal."  

1964 Civil Rights Act  

Many identity groups are protected under modern equal rights laws.  
Norway:  

* Gender
* Pregnancy
* Leave related to beirth and adoptoin
* Caring tasks
* Ethincity
* Relition
* Belief
* Disability
* Sexual orientation
* Gender identity
* Gender expression
* Age
* Combinations of identity experiences

Equity recognizes that we all have different needs. So treating everyone the same doesn't address these differences.  

### What is equity?

**Equity**: Treating people based on what they need to succeed, which may not be the same as what someone else might need.  

Implied is the need to correct historical conditions and situations.  

### Equity makes organizations stronger

Studys show more racial and gender diversity bring in more sales revenue and higher profits.  

Reshaping power dynamics to leverage diversity is where equity plays a key role.  

Power can increase inequities.  

Those with power are more likely to stereotype, less likely to listen to the perspectives of the less powerful, and are less empathetic.  

Recognize ingrained biases.  

1. Lessen power differentials by soliciting input.
2. Examine all policies and practices, and ask "who benefits?"
3. Think about who your "go-to" people are for special assignments.
4. Educate leaders on history of "-isms."
5. Foster a climate of transparency.
6. 

## 2. Level Setting: Equity and Inclusion in the Workplace

### What does equity in the workplace look like?

**Diversity**: The myriad of ways that we are different and similar including those characteristics that we can see and those that we cannot see.  

**Inclusion**: Creating an environment where everyone is appreciated for their uniqueness and feels like they belong, regardless of their identities.  

Equitable cultures are inclusive cultures. Equitable cultures create a sense of belonging.  

### How equity fosters fairness

**The Fallacy of Fairness:**  
An individual's attempt to apply similar rules to everyone in their lives.  

Fairness is subjective.  

#### Perception Check

* Why did I come to the conclusion that this was an unfair decision?
* What information informed my thinking?
* How much of my interpretation comes only from my perceitions?

Fairness should be done through an _equity_ lens, not an _equality_ lense.  

### Social justice advances equity

**Corporate Social Responsibility:**  
Businesses contribute to enhancing fairness and equity.  

**Environmental, Social, and Governance:**  
Giving back to the communities in which they do business.  

After George Floyd's murder, Cummings created it's CARE initiative:  

* Achive police reform
* Realize criminal justice reform
* Create economic empowerment by building Black wealth
* Drive social justince reform in healthcare, housing, workforce, development, and civil rights, including voting rights and education

## 3. What Equity Looks Like at Work

### Gender equity for women

**Pay Equity:**  
Explore the systemic issues like conscious or unconscious biases, social norms, educational opportunities, and other factors.  

Unconscious bias negatively affects equity for women.  

### Gender equity for men

Societal norms lead to stereotypes about manly behavior.  

***Negative Outcomes of Male Stereotypes:**  

* Expectations difficult to satisfy
* Feeling pressure and inadequacy
* Suppression of emotions

### Racial/ethnic equity

"We will know that we have equity when we can no longer predict outcomes by one's identity."  

Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC)  

Parity.  

**Primary Reasons for Inequity:**  

* Unconscious bias
* Stereotypes
* Dominant cuiltural norms

"Executive presence."  

### Sexual orientation equity

Long in coming, and a long way to go.  

In 2020 the SCOTUS applied Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the LGBTQ community.  

* Identity
* Attraction
* Expression
* Sex

Understand terminology.  

OSHA: All employees, including transgendered employees, should have access to restrooms that correspond to their gender identiy.  

Unisex bathrooms accomodate trans and others.  

### Equity for people with disabilities

**Disability:**  
Individual functioning, including physical impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, intellectual impairment, mental illness, and various types of chronic desease.  

Persons with disability have unemployment rates 30% higher than the general population.  

* Reasonable accommodations
* Accessibility

**Neurodiversity:**  
A concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation.  

Example: Autism spectrum.  

## 4. Fostering Equity: Hiring, Promotions, and Development

### Equity in hiring

Three recommendations:  

1. Audit your hiring practices and set **goals** and **accountability measures**.  
   * Intentionality and Accountability 
2. Enhance your **cultural competence**.
3. Assess each part of your pipeline for **assumptions** and **limited perspectives**.

#### Reflective Challenge

* What is wrong?
* How could they source candidates more equitably?
* What would you have done differently?

### Equity in promotions

The higher you go, the fewer BIPOC or women emplouyees you see.  

* The Broken Rung (the first step to moving into positions of leadership)

Go beyond mentorship to sponsorship (advocacy).  

### Equitable leadership

**Power Brokers:**  
Deliberately affect the distribution of political or economic power by exerting influence in their own organization and with others.  

* Achieve police reform
* Realize criminal justice reform
* Create economic empowerment
* Drive reform in healthcare, housing, workforce, and civil rights

Recognize that systemic inequity, injustice, and exclusion are real and exist everywhere.  

Know you are responsible and accountable for creating and sustaining equity and justice.  

Be willing to engage in your own self-critique, reflection, and learning, recognizing personal work is necessary to drive broader change.  

Prioritize and allocate ample resources to sustain this work.  

Accept resistance, conflict, and discomfort as requisite to progress.  

## 5. An Equitable Roadmap for the Future

### Correct past harm

Examples:  

* Japanese internment
* Tuskegee study survivors

Land acknowledgement.  

#### Correcting Past Harm

* Change lending policies
* Remove unneeded barriers to access capital
* Make sure people of color are on the boards of the institutions that make decisions about policies
* Recognize that historical structures built when racism was legal still perpetuate inequities today

Equity is hard.  

### Equity is good for all of us

Increase the success of all groups.  

Require leaders to be more conscious of their choices.  

SMS was invneted for the hard of hearing. Now we all use it and possibly couldn't imagine life without it.  

Diversity benefits everyone.  

### Abundance mindset for equity

#### Scarcity Mindset

* "Us and them"
* Blame "them" for everything

Genuinely care about the humanity inherent in every single person, and understand that **their existence enhances, not diminishes, our own**.  

Scarcity is an issue of poor allocation of resources, **not a lack of resources**.  

Fairness means we have to **consider each circumstance** and not assume that everyone should necessarily be treated the same.  

Equity is necessary to achieve equality. We may have to **give some people more to level the playing field**.  

### Language matters

Honor people's identities.  

* Put people first.
* Honor pronouns.

#### Example pronouns

* He/him/his
* She/her/hers
* They/them/their

Avoid gender specific terms like "hi guys!"  

* Everyone
* Team
* You all
* Y'all

People of color, not colored people.  

Respect more specific identity labels.  

Avoid "diverse" as a euphamism for what you really mean.  

If you don't know, ask.  

### The role you can play

Learn the history of other cultures.  
Become an aspiring ally.  
Join employee resource groups.  
Respect **boundaries**.  
Pay Equity.
